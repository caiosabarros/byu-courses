        <p style="color: #274713;">I'm passionate about the power computers have to perform computation. I love math as
            well, so
            I think
            computers are the best way to bridge the gap between math and speed. My interests range from
            <strong>blockchain</strong>, <strong>machine learning</strong>,<strong>cybersecurity</strong>,
            and<strong>quantum computing</strong>.

        <p>
            Welcome to my portfolio website! This website is designed for you, a recruiter! If you are not a recruiter,
            thanks for visiting anyways! The page shows my work in two different areas that I have adventured myself in:
            <strong><em>web3</em></strong> and <strong><em>cybersecurity</em></strong>. In both you will find a mix of
            educational content I have created - or completed -
            as well as my work in the area, which may be different for each category. In the future, I intend to also
            add my work in <strong>quantum cybernetics</strong>. Actually, this is where I am trying to head towards
            with my work in web3 and cyber. Have a look at both pages and see
            what you like about it!

        <h3>Web3</h3>
        <p>
            Since 2021, I have gained interest in the blockchain industry, mostly because of its mission delete the
            middle-man of the game in everything we do. In this page, you will get links to verified smart contracts I
            have deployed on different mainnets/testnets and also my work on open-source content, whether it be
            educational or functional. My experience varies from deploying more than 7 contracts on mainnet, writing
            about ten different articles to help in the education of the community and also creating high-quality videos
            for it. The main tools used in these articles and videos are: Remix, remixd, Geth, web3.js, testnets,
            Ganache, Truffle, Hardhat, mocha, etc. All these tools - as well as the more recent ones in the market, like
            Foundry - are a must for developing and testing smart contracts. Not only I helped in creating content for
            the community, but I also have been benefitted by it. I have participated in different bootcamps by Encode,
            like the <em><strong>Expert Solidity Bootcamp</em></strong>, <em><strong>ZK Bootcamp</strong></em> and soon
        </p>
        <p>
            Soon, I
            will participate in the <em><strong>zkEVM Bootcamp</strong></em>. Therefore, this Web3 section also has
            some certificates I have received over the course of my education in web3, including the ones I have
            mentioned, but also other courses I have done by other courses providers, like the <em><strong>Smart
                    Contract Hacking Course</strong></em>, that gave me enough experience to launch my current job:
            an <strong>independent smart contract security researcher</strong>. Hence, recently I have been using the
            knowledge
            acquired to search for vulnerabilities in live smart contracts that offer a bug bounty program.
        </p>
        <p>My future ambitions in the Web3 space is to learn the ZK technology. This includes learning the Rust
            language, the L2's main funcitonalities and flows and search for vulnerabilities on these kind of protocols
            as well. I have a passion for development as well though, so alongside security I also intend to, in the
            future, develop something that adds value to the community, like a cool protocol. For example, since I have
            done some ML courses and I like it - not as web3, but I like it as well - I intend to do something related
            to the ZKML field. It is a new field with some research being done on it, but I think it is going to
            revolutionaze the power of AI when AI has privacy on it as well.</p>

        <h3>CyberSecurity</h3>
        <p>
            I began my experience in CyberSecurity in the year of 2023. It is recent therefore. But I found it
            fascinating because of how much I have to learn and how it requires something I love:
            <strong><em>creativity</em></strong>. You will
            see some certificates and CTFs I have completed in the field on this page.
        </p>
        <p>
            My future ambitions in this area is to be able to learn all the attack vectors in a Rust-based approach. I
            intend then to translate the attack vectors I will learn in C or python into Rust, finish the course I am
            doing right now and complete some certifications in the field. After that, I want to dive into bug bounty
            programs as well, since these require lots of creativity, and I.LOVE.IT!
            A field of interest of mine for the future in CyberSecurity is <strong>quantum cybernetics</strong>. The
            idea of quantum computing and its possibility to break the RSA algorithms that have been used extensively in
            Web2 or Web3 is something that has been sparking lots of research so that we can try securing our systems in
            a post-quantum scenario.
