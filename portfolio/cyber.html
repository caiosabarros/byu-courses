        <p>Well, not yet! I actually have not done sufficient work in the cybersecurity. I'm currently a bug hunter on
            Immunefi, but this is more focused in the web3 industry. However, I want to make some progress on the
            cybersecurity industry as soon as possible. Stay tuned!</p>
        <p>Any questions, don't hesitate to send me an email at <em>caiohenriquesa1@gmail.com</em></p>
